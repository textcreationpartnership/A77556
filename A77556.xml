            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of right it belongs to you; for your deſire, which the receipt of many favours obliged me to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, brought it firſt to the Pulpit, now to the Preſſe. The conſciouſneſſe of my inſufficiencie in the Worke of the Miniſterie, and of the weakneſſe, and unworthineſſe of this Sermon, ſo ſuddenly conceived, made me for a time moſt unwilling to expoſe it to the publike ſight, and
<pb facs="tcp:156027:3"/>cenſure of this queaſie, and diſtempered time. But your importunitie hath now drawn it from me, and you have it in the ſame forme, wherein it was deliverd, And though it be a plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (according to my countrey courſe of Preaching) yet, as it did affect the Hearts, and Conſciences of the Hearers, ſo I hope it will not be unpleaſing, or unprofitable to the Readers. And may it, by the good bleſsing of God, affoord any comfort to your ſelf, or any other truly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, I have that, which I expect, and pray for. Sir, I am bold to inſcribe it to your name, as a teſtimonie of my Gratitude for your unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved reſpect to me; and a pledge of my true deſire to further you in your journey towards Heaven, by commending this Sermon to your Meditation, this Saint to your Imitation. Theſe, with all other means of grace the Lord ſo bleſſe to you, that you may be ſanctified throughout; and I pray God your whole ſpirit, and ſoule, and bodie be preſerved blameleſſe unto the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

            <head>THE TESTIMONIE GIVEN TO THE WORSHIPFULL AND and moſt Religious Ladie, THE LADY <hi>LVCIE IERVOICE</hi> AT HER FVNERALL <hi>Aug.</hi> 26. 1641.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are here aſſembled by the good providence of Almightie God, to celebrate the Funerall of the right Worſhipfull and moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady, the Lady <hi>Lucie Iervoice.</hi> A dutie which Affection, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Religion doe impoſe upon us. Theſe three Heraulds doe enjoyne us, <hi>justa perſolvere,</hi> ſo to give the dead their due, that the memoriall of the juſt may be bleſſed, and their names may be had in everlaſting remembrance.</p>
            <p>Now to the right performance of Chriſtian Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, two things have ever beene thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the bodies of the Saints be decently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156027:4"/>laid up in the darke chamber of the grave; <hi>ut molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſsa cubent,</hi> there to ſleep in peace with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to reſt in hope of a joyfull, and glorious reſurrection at the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we tender to the deceaſed ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the qualitie of their perſons deſerved. For the graces, and vertues of the Saints muſt not be raked up with their bodies in duſt, and aſhes; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their deſerved commendation to the due praiſe of the grace of God; then eſpecially when the lives of the deceaſed may be ſet forth as exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and patternes of vertue to the living.</p>
            <p>And ſuch I am ſure, was the life, and death of this moſt gracious Ladie. She lived like a Saint; and ſhe dyed like a Saint. Her life was full of grace; her latter end was full of peace.</p>
            <p>We finde in Scripture many women much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for ſome ſpeciall vertues wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled. <hi>Sarah</hi> is commended for obedience. <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi> for wiſdome. <hi>Mary</hi> for faith. <hi>Martha</hi> for hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. <hi>Anna</hi> for devotion. <hi>Dorcas</hi> for charitie. <hi>Eunice</hi> for the pious education of her ſonne <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie:</hi> but of this Ladie, whoſe dead body lyeth here before us, I may ſay without falſhood, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, in the words of <hi>Lemuels</hi> mother. <hi>Many daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have done vertuouſly, but thou excelleſt them all,</hi> Prov. 31.39.</p>
            <p>Her vertues were many, more by many then I am able to relate to you. If I could, the whole time allotted for this exerciſe would faile me. And therefore like a man in haſt, I will run over the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of her life, and here, and there crop a flowre to make a Garland of praiſe to ſet upon her Hearſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156027:4"/>and a ſpirituall pofie for every one of you. And when you have it, part not with it, carry it away in your boſomes with you, and it will perfume your words, and actions, and make you, as ſhe was, a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve, and imitate her <hi>Pietie,</hi> which ſhined forth amongſt us in the conſtant practice of a godly life. It may be ſaid of Men, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth of the creatures for meat, <hi>they are ſanctified by the word and prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the principall means the Lord hath ſanctified, to ſanctifie us. And to both theſe, this moſt pious Ladie did give diligent attendance, both privately, and publikely.</p>
            <p>For her <hi>Private Devotion,</hi> ſhe was a rare and moſt ſingular patterne for our imitation. For it was her conſtant courſe, both Winter and Summer to riſe very early; from her Bed immediatly ſhe repaired to her Cloſet; and there for a time ſhe gave her ſelf to devout prayer, and divine meditation: having offered up this ſacrifice to God, then, like <hi>Salomons</hi> vertuous woman, <hi>ſhe gave meat to her houſhold, and a portion to her maidens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ordered the affaires of her Familie, then ſhe returned to her Cloſet againe, where for the moſt part ſhe ſpent divers houres in praying, and reading the Scriptures, and other good bookes tending to godly inſtruction. Having thus trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up her ſoul, then ſhe dreſſed her body, which done, ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe to prayer againe with her whole Familie before dinner. And, if occaſions did permit, ſhe ſpent much of the afternoone in prayer, ſtudie, and meditation; never neglecting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156027:5"/>to pray with her Family in the Evening; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe lay down to take her reſt, her manner was in private prayer to recommend her ſelfe, and all belonging to her to Gods gracious protection. Thus this pious Ladie did dreſſe up her ſoul, like the lamp in the Tabernacle, every morning, and every evening with the ſweet oyle Olive of pure Devotion.</p>
            <p>Now touching her <hi>publike Devotion,</hi> in this ſhe was moſt exemplarie. With <hi>David</hi> ſhe rejoyced to goe to the houſe of the Lord. With <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to ſit at the feet of Chriſt to heare him preaching to her in the Miniſtery of the word. Her behaviour in Gods houſe was ſo decent, ſo comely, and full of humble reverence; her Amen to the prayers of the Church, and all her anſwers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Liturgie were uttered ſo orderly, ſo audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſo affectionately, and ſo zealouſly, that I muſt confeſſe I never obſerved in any more reverence, attention, and zeale in the publike ſervice, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of her Pietie, was her love to the Miniſters of God. She reſpected all for their callings ſake; but did highly eſteeme ſuch as ſhe obſerved to be faithfull in the worke of the Lord. An evident ſigne that ſhe tooke much comfort, and taſted much ſweetneſſe in the water of Life, who ſo loved, and reſpected that Pipe, thorow which the Lord did conveigh the ſame into her.</p>
            <p>Many other evidences of her Pietie, I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in. As her readineſſe to offer, and entertaine holy Conference. Her delight in ſuch as did excell in vertue. Her encouraging, and rewarding vertue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156027:5"/>in thoſe that did belong to her. Her hatred of vice in her ſelf, in thoſe that were neere, and deere to her, and in all that did attend upon her. She oppoſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as ſinne. She was never offended with children, or ſervants, for any thing ſo much as for ſin. She deſired, and endeavoured nothing ſo much, as to ſerve God with her whole houſhold. Now from theſe premiſes wee muſt needs inferre this Concluſion. That ſhe was a moſt Pious Lady.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve, and Imitate her <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> She was a Lady of excellent underſtanding. In Huſwiferie, in Chirurgerie, in Phyſick, &amp;c. But principally in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, which concerned Gods worſhip, and mans ſalvation. She was wiſe to ſalvation. By continuall ſtudy and meditation, the word of God became ſo familiar to her, dwelt ſo plentifully in her, that ſhe was able (as occaſion was offered) to rehearſe pertinent places of Scripture, and much of her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary language was in Scripture phraſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve, and Imitate her <hi>Charitie.</hi> She loved the poore as the members of Chriſt, in word and deed, wiſhing well, and doing well to all, though ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſtood in need of her reliefe, and comfort. She was a Chirurgion to ſuch as were hurt, and may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And oftentimes dreſſed with her owne hand ſuch putrified ſoares, that ſome, who waited on her. did loath to looke upon. She was a Phyſician to the ſicke, and diſeaſed. And as her skill this way was more then ordinarie, ſo moſt ready, and willing ſhe was to be at much charge, to beſtow any paines to further their recovery. She was alſo Chriſts Almoner to the poore and needy. While ſhe lived, never did any hungry belly goe from her doore unfed. As God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156027:6"/>had given plentifully to her, ſo ſhe gave plentifully to God againe in the poore members of Chriſt: not only appointing food to be given them by the hands of ſervants, but like <hi>Salomons</hi> vertuous woman. <hi>She ſtretched forth her hand to the poore, and reached out both her hands to the needie,</hi> Prov. 31.20.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Obſerve, and Imitate her <hi>Humilitie.</hi> Though many things, whereof others be proud, were not wanting in her, as Birth, Riches, Reputation, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts of Art, and Nature, yet ſhe alwayes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the Lords humble handmaid. Through humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſhe made her ſelfe equall to thoſe that be of a low degree; and was even a companion of poore ones that feared the Lord. She deſpiſed the ornaments of vanitie, which other Ladies, and Gentlewomen too much delight in, and dote upon: Her outward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite did ſhew the inward modeſtie, lowlineſſe, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of her minde. She was ever humble in the ſight of her ſins; never in ſickneſſe, or health flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe with any thing ſhe had done; but ever condemning her ſelfe, and complaining of her owne ſins, and unworthineſſe.</p>
            <p>Now this, which hath been ſaid, is enough to prove her a moſt gracious Lady: But nothing ſo much as may be ſpoken in the praiſe of her. Me thinks I heare her ſorrowfull husband praiſe her, ſaying, that to him ſhe was a wiſe, humble, loving, loyall, and moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <hi>Wife.</hi> Me thinks I heare her children praiſe her, ſaying, that to them ſhe was a moſt loving, tender, prudent, provident, and moſt pious <hi>Mother.</hi> Me thinks I heare her ſervants praiſe her, ſaying, that to them ſhe was a moſt meeke, gentle, loving, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>Lady,</hi> a zealous reprover of their vices, but a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156027:6"/>bountifull rewarder of their true, and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Me thinks I heare all, both men and women praiſe her, and ſaying, that ſhe was the ornament of her ſex, a great and light ſhining in a darke place.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleaſed God to infuſe into the heart of this Lady, a meaſure more then ordinary of heavenly Grace, which was not hid in her, as a light under a buſhell; but it ſhined forth to all with whom ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed; ſo that by the ſhining of her light, and the ſight of her good works, others were provoked and directed to glorifie God our heavenly father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as the Courſe of her Life was religious, So the Concluſion of her life was moſt gracious;</hi> witneſſe her moſt Saintlike behaviour in her laſt ſickneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe graces were viſible to all about her.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Patience</hi> which was admirable. It pleaſed God to viſit her with a long, and ſometimes moſt ſharpe, and painfull ſickneſſe, which moſt piouſly ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the Lords viſitation, and apprehending the hand of the Lord in it, moſt patiently ſhe ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelfe to the Lords heavenly will and pleaſure, reſting contented to live; but willing to die, yea ſo willing, that ever and anon ſhee was uttering Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> wiſh. <hi>I deſire to be diſsolved and to be with Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> To her patience adde her</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Repentance,</hi> which, I am confidently aſſured, was moſt ſincere, and heartie, teſtified oft-times by moſt penitentiall confeſſions, and moſt fervent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for grace, and mercie. To her repentance adde her</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Pietie.</hi> Wherein ſhe profited much whilſt ſhe continued in the Schoole of affliction. Her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was to her as the waters of the flood were to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156027:7"/>Arke of <hi>Noah;</hi> the longer it continued, the more it encreaſed, the higher it did beare up her thoughts, and deſires towards heaven. Her whole time ſhe ſpent in reading, or hearing of others reade to her; in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her ſelfe, or with others; in holy conference; in heavenly meditations; and ever and anon her ſoul was ſending up ſome ſhort, and ſweet ejaculations, with ſuch zeale, and fervencie of ſpirit, in words ſo full of divinitie, and devotion, with ſuch elevation of hands, and eyes, that ſhe afforded hereby much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and benefit to all that did viſit her, or attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. Adde to theſe her</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith.</hi> Which was firmely built upon the Rock Chriſt Jeſus. Him ſhe acknowledged to be her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all-ſufficient Redeemer; and ſtedfaſtly rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his merits for ſalvation. And through him ſhe made a ſure peace with God, and gained a full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of ſalvation; as appeared by thoſe words ſhe ſpake to a deare friend, one Miſtris <hi>Reynolds. O daughter he is come, he is come.</hi> To which ſhe replying. Who is come Madam? ſhe anſwered in words to this purpoſe. The Spirit of comfort is come, and hath teſtified to my ſpirit that Chriſt Jeſus is mine, and that through him heaven ſhall be mine hereafter. And hereupon, like the bleſſed virgin, <hi>Her ſoul did magnifie the Lord, and her ſpirit rejoyced in God her Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more I deſire to acquaint you with, which in my judgement was moſt remarkable, an argument that her ſoul was Angelized in her body, and emparifed there before it could get out to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It was this.</p>
            <p>Upon the Sunday before her departure, towards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156027:7"/>the Evening of the day, her ſpirit fainted, and ſhe fell into a ſwound (or it may be ſome heavenly rapture) in which for ſome ſpace ſhe continued; but breath being perceived to be in her, they who were about her did ſtrive to revive her; and by Gods bleſſing upon the means uſed by her learned Phyſician, ſhe not onely came to her ſelfe, but ſome reaſonable ſtrength, and vigour was added to her. And having firſt praiſed God, as her accuſtomed manner was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every receipt of comfort from him, ſhe deſired that all her children might be brought to her, which done, like a moſt gracious Mother ſhe bleſſed them all, ſaying. The God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> bleſſe you, and beſtow upon you, not greatneſſe but goodneſſe, not riches but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the Graces of his holy Spirit, that every one of you may live in the feare of God, in the faith of Chriſt, in all dutie and obedience to your father, and true love to one another all the dayes of your life. Theſe, and many other gracious Exhortations ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to her children. And having given a holy and heavenly farewell to them, ſhe commanded that all her ſervants might come before her. And to every one of them ſhe uttered gracious words. Exhorting them to live godly, righteouſly, and ſoberly, and warning them particularly, to beware of thoſe ſins which ſhe had obſerved them to be moſt addicted to. And having made an end of bleſſing her children, and ſervants, and taught them how to live, ſhe then in a moſt gracious manner prepared her ſelfe to die. Spending the time that remained behind in fervent prayer to God, to enable her to reſiſt the aſſaults of the Divell, and to endure the pangs of death, and that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156027:8"/>would ſend her a bleſſed departure, and a mercifull admiſſion of her ſoul into his heavenly Kingdome. At length feeling her ſelf at the very gates of death, ſhe deſired a reverend Miniſter then with her, once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to pray for her. His prayer being ended, and her life almoſt ended too, ſhe thus commended her ſelfe to God. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with me to the end and in the end, Amen.</hi> And this prayer ſhe repeated againe and againe, till her breath grew ſo ſhort, that ſhe was not able to repeat it any longer; and then ſhe ſealed up her prayer, and her life too with <hi>Amen.</hi> Ingeminating of it till her ſoul departed.</p>
            <p>A heavenly Concluſion of a holy life. <hi>Sic mihi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingat vivere, ſic<expan>

            <p>Now this portion of Scripture which I have read unto you, containes in it the ſecond of theſe four laſt things, namely, the day of Judgement. The ſerious meditation whereof is a powerfull means to provoke us to timely, and true repentance. Sure I am, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought it ſo; and therefore he uſeth no other argument to turne the ſuperſtitious Athenians from their Idolatry, and to perſwade them, and all men every where to repent, but onely this.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:156027:9"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance to all men in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words being taken in the whole lump to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether may very fitly be called. <hi>Gods Statute for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall judgement by Chriſt the righteous Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly they offer to our conſideration, theſe ſixe points.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The certaintie of the day of Judgement. <hi>[Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath appointed it]</hi> and what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ſhall certainly be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who ſhall judge? <hi>[he will Iudge]</hi> which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God mentioned in the verſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fore-going.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Who ſhall be judged? <hi>[the world]</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Angels in Heaven, Divels in Hell, Men, and unreaſonable and Inanimate Creatures on earth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How God will judge? <hi>[in righteouſneſſe]</hi> reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man according to his works.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By whom God will judge? <hi>[by the man whom he hath ordained]</hi> that is by Jeſus Chriſt. He is the Man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be Judge of quick, and dead. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The warrant to aſſure us that Chriſt ſhall judge the world. <hi>[whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus within the narrow Compaſſe of this text we have a day for Judgement, a God to judge, a World to be judged, a righteous Sentence to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Chriſt Jeſus in Commiſſion, and his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our aſſurance. Of all which particulars in that order as I have ranked them, and as the Text offers them to our conſideration.</p>

               <head>1. The Certaintie of the Day of Judgement.</head>
               <p>That there ſhall be a Day of Judgement, is a truth of infallible certaintie.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Scripture teacheth it.</item>
                  <item>2. Conſcience teſtifyeth it.</item>
                  <item>3. Reaſon concludeth it.</item>
                  <item>4. Particular judge ments premonſtrate it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Scripture plainly, and plentifully teaches it, in which we often meet with theſe, and the like ſayings. <hi>God will bring every worke to Iudgement, with every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing whether it be good, or whether it be evill.</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 12.14. <hi>We muſt all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good, or bad.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10. Adde to theſe the Propheſie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> recorded, <hi>Iudges</hi> 14.15. <hi>Behold the Lord commeth with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all.</hi> And in this the laſt Apoſtle agrees with the firſt Prophet. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>he commeth with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him,</hi> Revel. 1.7. Many more texts might be alleadged conſonant to theſe, but your knowledge, and beliefe of this matter aſſures me that this labour would be ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſcience</hi> teſtifies it. Yea alſo the conſcience of the the vileſt Atheiſt, it will be as a thouſand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to confirme it. How often are they filled with unſpeakable horrour, eſpecially in death? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is thus with them? becauſe conſcience tels that die they muſt, and after death muſt come to judgement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Humane Reaſon</hi> enlightened by holy Scripture conceives, and concludes that there ſhall be a day of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156027:10"/>Judgement. Looke abroad into the world and you ſhall ſee a wonderfull confuſion of things, a ſtrange inequalitie of Divine diſpenſations. The wicked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times flouriſh, and enjoy great proſperitie, when the righteous are afflicted, and endure great adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Now though ſome doe from hence conclude, that there is no preſent providence, and ſhall be no future judgement; yet this confuſion of things, and inequalitie of Divine diſpenſations is an argument ſufficient in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinitie, to prove a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. Heare what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes from Athens to his perſecuted Theſſalonians. <hi>Your perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and tribulations which you endure, is a manifeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> (or an evident demonſtration) <hi>of the righteous Iudgement of God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.4, 5. And <hi>Salomon</hi> before him in his ſurvey of vanities ſaith, <hi>I ſaw under the Sun the place of judgement, that wickedneſſe was there, and the place of righteouſneſse that iniquitie was there,</hi> And what doth <hi>Salomon</hi> inferre from hence? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no providence? therefore no judgement to come? No, but the plaine contrary, <hi>I ſaid in my heart God ſhall judge the righteous, and the wicked, for a time there is for every purpoſe, and for every worke,</hi> Eccles. 3.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Particular judgements</hi> which God inflicteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men in this life, doe prove the univerſall. The drowning of the old world, the burning of Sodom, and Gomorrah, the plaguing of Egypt, the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeruſalem, and more particular judgements upon particular perſons, all theſe are <hi>praeludia judicii univerſalis,</hi> forerunners, and foretellers of a generall judgement. Some ſinnes are puniſhed here, that we might know that there is a Providence, and a Judge
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:156027:10"/>that takes notice of every ſin; and ſome ſins paſſe here unpuniſhed, that we might expect a greater, and ſtricter judgement to come hereafter. Thus Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, Conſcience teſtifyeth, Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, and preſent Judgements doe demonſtrate the truth of my propounded Doctrine, <hi>that there ſhall be a day of judgement.</hi> So I diſmiſſe the firſt Point, and come to the ſecond.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>2. <hi>Who ſhall Iudge?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall Iudge,</hi> ſaith the Text, where the word <hi>(He)</hi> hath relation to God mentioned in the foregoing verſe, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God commandeth all men every where to repent, Becauſe he hath appointed a day in which he will judge.</hi>
               </p>

The whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſhall concurre in this work, being as the Schooles ſay, <hi>Opus ad extra,</hi> an <hi>Externall</hi> work of the Godhead. And it is an Axiome in Divinitie. <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa.</hi> The externall works of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, admit not of any diviſion in the perſons of the Deitie. It is true, there be certaine <hi>Internall works,</hi> which are incommunicably proper to every Perſon. It is incommunicably proper to the perſon of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to have his being of himſelf. It is incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably proper to the Perſon of the <hi>Son,</hi> to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the <hi>Father.</hi> And it is incommunicably proper to the Perſon of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to proceed from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> But thoſe works by which the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things</hi> of the Godhead are made manifeſt to the Creature, as Creation, Preſervation, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this of <hi>Iudgement</hi> are equally, and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156027:11"/>to be aſcribed to the ſacred three in one, and to God in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected. That albeit in this place judgement be attributed <hi>eſſentially</hi> to God; yet in other places it is attributed <hi>perſonally,</hi> and <hi>reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi> to Chriſt. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. Again, ſometimes this worke of judging is appropriated to the Saints. <hi>Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.2. How ſhall theſe places be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled which affirme that God, and Chriſt, and the Saints ſhall Judge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This threefold doubt is eaſily diſſolved by a threefold diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to Judge, becauſe the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> of judging belongeth to God onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ</hi> is ſaid to Judge, becauſe God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of Judgement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Saints</hi> are ſaid to Judge, becauſe they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and give <hi>atteſtation</hi> to the ſentence which Chriſt ſhall pronounce of <hi>ſalvation</hi> to the godly; of <hi>damnation</hi> to the wicked.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Authoritie</hi> is Gods. The <hi>Execution</hi> is Chriſts. The <hi>Approbation</hi> is the Saints. This diſtinction is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to free the Scripture from the leaſt <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and the point from this <hi>objection.</hi> And now having cleared the point, that <hi>Almightie God onely ſhall judge the world.</hi> I will confirme it by two reaſons, drawne from two Attributes in God, proving him onely fit to be the Judge of all the world.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is drawne from Gods <hi>Omniſcience;</hi> the knowledge of the Lord like himſelfe is <hi>Infinite,</hi> nothing can be hid from his ſight: <hi>Heaven</hi> is not ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156027:11"/>high but he can reach it: <hi>Hell</hi> is not ſo deep, but he can ſearch it: The <hi>Earth</hi> is not ſo wide, but he can ſpan it: the <hi>Night</hi> is not ſo darke, but he can ſee it: the <hi>Chamber,</hi> the <hi>Bed,</hi> the <hi>Cloſet</hi> is not ſo cloſe, but <hi>he, whoſe eyes are as flames of fire,</hi> can pierce it.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:156027:13"/>this word <hi>World</hi> hath ſpeciall reference in this place: teaching us that all men without exception of any ſhall come to judgement.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156027:14"/>two to cleere ſome few texts which at the firſt view ſeeme to have a flat contradiction.</p>
               <p>One is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The ungodly ſhall not ſtand in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> The Septuagint turne it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo many Latine fathers read it, <hi>non reſurgent, ſhall not riſe in judgement,</hi> a bad tranſlation, it may be want of skill in the Hebrew made them to follow the Septuagint, who were Jews, amongſt whom many held an hereſie that <hi>the ſouls of ſinners ſhould periſh with their bodies,</hi> which errour receives not the leaſt ſtrength from theſe words of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> wherein he means not that the wicked ſhall not come to be judged; but they ſhall not be acquitted in iudgement, they ſhall be found guiltie, and ſhall fall into eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Another Place is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18 <hi>He that beleeveth not is condemned already.</hi> Now if all unbeleevers be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, what need is there of any further iudgement?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer. It cannot be denyed, that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are already condemned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Gods eternall decree, who hath appointed them to condemnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Gods word which denounceth damnation to to all that beleeve not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In their owne Conſciences which ſerve as a thouſand witneſſes to accuſe them, as a Judge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, and as an executioner to torment them. But all this hinders not, but that they muſt appeare before the iudgement ſeat of the Lord that their ſins may be openly manifeſted, their ſentence publikely pronounced, for the fuller manifeſtation of Gods iuſtice to all the world.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:156027:14"/>
               <p> Another place is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>He that beleeveth in God, ſhall not come into judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That in this place our Saviour by a Trope, putteth <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though it properly ſignifies judgement, yet it is rendred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Which though it be not a right tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is a true and ſound Expoſition, for the meaning of our Saviour is, that the faithfull though they ſhall come to judgement, yet they ſhall never come into condemnation. They ſhall not come into the Judgement of damnation, but they ſhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Judgement of eternall Abſolution from their ſins, and miſeries. That which they have here in part, muſt then be perfected: that which they have here by faith, ſhall then be revealed, a finall deliverance from the thraldome of this world, to the glorious libertie of the ſons of God. And ſo much for the third point. I proceed to the fourth.</p>

                  <hi>He will judge in righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith the Text. That is the Lords judiciall proceeding at the laſt Day in judging ſome to the eternall &amp; unutterable joyes and glory of Heaven; and in dooming others to the eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and remedileſſe torments of Hell ſhall be moſt juſt, and righteous. Hence the Day of Judgement is called by Saint <hi>Paul, The day of the Revelation of the righteous judgement of God, Rom.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>Now the juſtice, and righteouſneſſe of the Lords proceeding at the laſt Day, ſhall be declared to all the world two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God will have no reſpect of perſons,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. That is, in the act of Judging, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156027:15"/>Lord will not reſpect the outward qualitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any, as Countrey, Sex, Wealth, Povertie, Age, Youth, Beautie, Deformitie, Honour, Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or any outward circumſtance whatſoever; none of theſe things ſhall in the leaſt wiſe move the Lord to reward, or puniſh. <hi>Eſaus</hi> elderſhip ſhall not remove the Lords hate; nor <hi>Iacobs</hi> minoritie hinder the Lords love: <hi>Sauls</hi> Scepter ſhall not ſhelter him from Gods wrath, nor <hi>Davids</hi> ſheep-hooke hold him backe from Gods bleſſing: <hi>Lazarus</hi> his povertie ſhall not keepe him out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, nor <hi>Dives</hi> his wealth free him from the place of torment: It ſhall be no impeachment to <hi>Cornelius</hi> that he was a Gentile, nor immunitie to any that he was a Jew: But whoſoever he be, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, poore or rich, male or female that feareth God, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, he ſhall be accepted to ſalvation: and whoſoever he be that feareth not God, and worketh unrighteouſneſſe, without partialitie he ſhall be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to damnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God will reward every man according to his works,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. Evill works are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine evidences of infidelitie; and good works are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable fruits, and infallible teſtimonies, and ſignes of ſaving faith: and therefore God, to declare himſelf a righteous Judge, will make our works the rule of his retribution. To every ſoul that doth evill, God will render indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh for evermore: but to every ſoul that worketh good, God will render Glory, honour, peace, and eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9, 10. So juſt a retribution will the Lord at the laſt day render to every perſon, that all the world ſhall ſay, <hi>Iuſt art thou, O Lord, and true, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156027:15"/>righteous are thy Iudgements, Revel.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But here two Queſtions may very fitly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether good works are meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſalvation? becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man according to his works,</hi> and he ſaith it to this end, to declare the juſt and righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To which I anſwer, that the uſuall collection of the Papiſts from this, and the like places is; that therefore the good works of men juſtified, and in grace are meritorious cauſes of eternall life. But the judgement of our Church, and all other Reformed Churches is this; that however good works done in grace, are acceptable to God in Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhall by him be rewarded; yet that acceptance, and reward is not deſerved by our works, but is freely beſtowed out of the grace, and mercy of God. And this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination we prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By Scripture,</hi> which moſt expreſſely teacheth every where, that eternall life is a free gift of Gods mercy, not a reward due to mans merit. See theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. and 11.5.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. and 3.7. I might adde more, but theſe are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By Reaſon,</hi> which being enlightened by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrongly argueth, and concludeth that good works are not, cannot be meritorious. 1. Becauſe we are creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.3. 2. We are ſinfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.2. 3. Our good works are not ours, but Gods, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. 4. They are a due debt, not ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.10. 5. They are ſtained with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and great imperfections, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. 6. They are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:156027:16"/>no way profitable, and beneficiall to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35.7. They are no way comparable to that glory, which hereafter ſhall be revealed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Now theſe things conſidered, how ſhall we ſay that good works are, or can be meritorious, that is, ſuch as by any value, or worth in them ſhould bind God to give a reward to them? eſpecially ſuch a tranſcendent excellencie, and waight of Glory, as is that of the kingdome of heaven?</p>
               <p>And who, but onely they to <hi>whom the Lord hath ſent ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould beleeve a lye,</hi> doth not diſcover the abſurditie of that collection, which the Papiſts doe inferre from our Apoſtles words? who ſaith not, that God will reward very man <hi>for</hi> his works, but <hi>according</hi> to his works: which phraſe doth not intimate the <hi>cauſe</hi> why eternall life is given; but the <hi>qualification</hi> of the perſons to whom eternall life is given: that they are ſuch as by faith are united to Chriſt, and bring forth good works, the fruits and evidences of that faith, whereunto in the Covenant of Grace, God hath made the promiſe of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Whereſoever therefore in Scripture a reward is ſaid to be rendred to good works of juſtice, as 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. the Scripture hath relation to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, not to any deſert of our own.</p>
               <p>Alſo, whereſoever mention is made of our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luc.</hi> 20.35. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.4. the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture means not that any are, or can be worthy by the merit, and dignitie of their own works: but that they are worthy in Gods gracious acceptation through the worthineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt imputed to them, and made theirs by a true, and lively faith. And ſo much for the firſt queſtion.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:156027:16"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. If God reward every man according to his works, How can God be juſt in puniſhing for ever, thoſe that ſinned for a ſhort time?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer. 1. In the words of a learned, and judicious writer of our own. <hi>Iuſtum eſt ut reprobi nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam careant ſupplicio, quia nunquam voluerunt carere peccato.</hi> Reprobates muſt juſtly ſuffer for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would never have ceaſed to ſin, if they had lived <hi>for ever.</hi> 2. The greatneſſe of a ſin, muſt not be meaſured by the Time in which it was acted, but by the <hi>Perſon</hi> againſt whom it was committed. Now men ſin againſt God, who is infinite; and therefore (juſtice requiring a portion between the offence, and the puniſhment) though ſin be temporary, yet it is moſt juſt with God to puniſh it with eternal torments. And ſo much for the fourth point. I proceed to the fift</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>By whom God will Iudge?</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>By that Man whom hee hath ordained,</hi> ſaith the Text. And this man can be no other but the <hi>Man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. So Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preached, and Chriſt commanded him, and the reſt of his Apoſtles to preach ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42. <hi>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to teſtifie that it is He which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to be the Iudge of quick and dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If reſpect be had to the power, and authoritie of Judging, then to judge us doth belong to the whole Trinitie, and that equally, as I ſaid before. But if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be had to the Adminiſtration of Judgement, and the viſible act of Judging, then to judge us doth belong to Chriſt onely. For he onely ſhall be ſeene to deſcend with a guard of Angels, to open the books of accounts, to examine the ſeverall cauſes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the finall ſentence, and to execute the ſame
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:156027:17"/>by the happy admiſſion of the Elect into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven prepared by the Father, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt to be the glorious, and eternall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints; and by the heavy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable diſmiſſion of reprobates, into that Lake which burnes with fire and brimſtone, before the Throne of God for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee Chriſt ſhall be the immediate mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and adminiſtrator of judgement. The Scripture is plentifull in the proofe of it. Wherein he is called the <hi>Wiſe Husbandman,</hi> that ſevereth the corne from the chaffe, the Wheat from the Tares: the <hi>good Shepherd</hi> that divideth the Sheepe from the Goats: the <hi>heavenly Bridegroome</hi> that ſeparateth the Wiſe from the fooliſh virgins: the <hi>great Lord</hi> that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſundry talents to his ſervants at their going, and called them to account how they had employed, and improved them at his returne. More plainly, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42. where he is called <hi>the Iudge of quick, and dead,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. where the day of Judgement is called <hi>the day of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> and, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. where the ſeat of judgement is called <hi>the judgement ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27. where Chriſt himſelf ſaith. <hi>The Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels: and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you aske a reaſon, why the adminiſtration and Execution of Judgement is committed to Chriſt. I referre you to <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.27. <hi>He hath given authoritie to him,</hi> that is, the Father hath given authoritie to Chriſt, <hi>to execute judgement, becauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> Here you ſee Chriſts commiſſion, <hi>to execute judgment,</hi> and the reaſon of it, <hi>becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi> About theſe laſt words, I find ſome difference amongſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:156027:17"/>
               <p> Some will have theſe words read, with the words following, after this manner. <hi>Becauſe he is the Son of man marvell not at this, for the time ſhall come when the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Son of God and ſhall come forth,</hi> &amp;c. That is, if it ſeeme wonderfull or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to any that the Son of man, ſhall have ſuch power to judge, you muſt conſider that he is the Son of God alſo; and at the day of judgement he ſhall mightily declare his Godhead by the reſurrection of the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> read the words thus, <hi>in quantum,</hi> or <hi>ſecundum quod filius hominis eſt,</hi> that is, in reſpect of his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, or as he is the ſon of man. And ſo make it a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not of Chriſts <hi>giving</hi> judgement, but of his <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> power to judge. For as Chriſt was the Son of God, power could not be given to him, for it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and eſſentially in himſelf; and as he was the Sonne of man he could not have power to execute judgement, untill it was given him of the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> underſtand this reaſon to be of the ſame force, with that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>He humbled himſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient to the death, even the death of the croſſe. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.</hi> So here becauſe the Son of God humbled himſelf ſo low to become the ſon of man, therefore God hath recompenſed his infinite humilitie, with this infinite glory to be the Judge of all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> interpret the words thus. That God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to Chriſt power to execute judgement, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by and according to his humanitie. For the wiſdome of God thought it meet, that men ſhould be judged by man, that whileſt wicked men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:156027:18"/>tremble and are full of feare, horrour and perplexitie; the ſimilitude of nature might make the elect full of joy, comfort and confidence.</p>
               <p>Now put all theſe readings together, they amount to this. That Chriſt Jeſus, as he is the ſon of man in honour, and reward of his great humilitie, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Father this great authority, this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power in his humane Nature to execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the laſt Day. And ſo I come to the laſt point.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The warrant to aſſure us that the World ſhall be judged by Chriſt.</head>
               <p>There is nothing more remote from the common ſenſe, and apprehenſion of men, then the great works of Chriſt at the laſt Day, in raiſing the dead, and bringing them with all thoſe that then remaine alive to judgement. To Chriſtians this is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, incredible. And therefore to convince the infidelitie of Heathens; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faith of Chriſtians, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſends us in the end of the text to the reſurrection of Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath given to all <hi>ſufficientiſsimam fidem</hi> ſaith <hi>Cajetan,</hi> a moſt ſufficient, certaine and infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of theſe three things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Dead ſhall be raiſed.</hi> Chriſts Reſurrection is a pledge of ours. For if Chriſt be riſen, then is our nature riſen; and if our nature be riſen, then our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may riſe; nay ſhall riſe at the laſt day, that is plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. <hi>The dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible,</hi> and they ſhall be raiſed by the Power of Chriſt, that is proved, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>The houre is coming in the which

               <head>The Application of this Doctrine touching the laſt judgement, in a threefold uſe.</head>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. This Doctrine of the laſt Judgement, ſerves for the <hi>Terrour</hi> of all unbeleevers, and ungodly livers. To ſuch the Preaching, and expectation of Judgement is as the <hi>Hand</hi> which appeared to <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wall the period of his life and kingdome: or as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156027:19"/>the <hi>Hand</hi> which was ſent to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which had a rowle in it, written within and without full of <hi>lamentations, mourning,</hi> and <hi>woe: Ezek.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls death <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the moſt fearefull of all things. He would not have ſaid ſo, had he known that <hi>after death comes judgement, Heb.</hi> 9.27. This exceeds that farre. Thats but <hi>timendum,</hi> fearefull; but this is <hi>tremendum, horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> terrible, dreadfull, <hi>Dreadfull</hi> in many reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Tis dreadfull in reſpect of the Preparation to Judgement; for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell ſhall cry, <hi>Surgite mortui, venite ad Iudicium,</hi> ariſe ye dead, and come to judgement. Then the graves ſhall open, the earth tremble, the Sear oare, the Stars fall, the powers of Heaven ſhake, the world burne, Hell ſmoake, and the Judge himſelfe ſhall come in flames of fire to render vengeance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tis dreadfull, in reſpect of the ſtrict and ſevere account the ungodly ſhall be called unto. For they muſt give account for their bodies which they have defiled; for their ſouls which they have neglected; for the creatures which they have abuſed; for the Sabbaths which they have polluted; for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they have profaned; for all the means of grace which they have deſpiſed; for their ſecret thoughts, idle words, and all evill deeds which they have ungodly committed. For all theſe they ſhall give account in ſo rigorous a manner, that no eye ſhall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie them, no tongue ſhall plead for them, no teares, no cryes ſhall procure them the leaſt mercy from their wrathfull Judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But moſt dreadfull it ſhall be, in reſpect of the direfull ſentence which ſhall be denounced againſt them. For Chriſt the righteous Judge wil ſay to them.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:156027:19"/>
                  <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devill and his angels, Matth.</hi> 29.41. A ſentence full of woe and horrour, what more wofull, more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, then to ſee ſo many admitted into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; and themſelves ſeparated from the place, and preſence of God, &amp; haled with ugly fiends into Hell, where the pains of the damned are unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, but unavoydable; eaſeleſſe, but endleſſe and remedileſſe? <hi>Dolor ſi longus, levis; ſi gravis, brevis,</hi> Pain is lightly, light, if long; ſhort, if great; tis ſo here; but this rule doth not hold in Hell. There is Darkneſſe that ends not, gnaſhing of teeth that ceaſeth not, bonds that breake not, wormes that dye not, fire that never ſhal be extinguiſhed. Damned ſouls ſhall howle, but none ſhall heare; roare but none ſhall help; looke round about, but ſee no means of comfort, nothing but that which helps to encreaſe their torments, which ſhall have neither eaſe nor end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh</hi> the fearefull caſe of all ungodly perſons at the day of judgement! what aking of Heart, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Minde, what horrour of Conſcience, what wringing of hands, what knocking of breaſts, what cryes filling Heaven, Earth and Hell ſhall be heard amongſt the wicked upon this day of vengeance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Doctrine of the laſt Judgement, miniſters matter of much comfort, and rejoycing to all ſuch as are true beleevers, and do lead a godly life. To them the day of Judgement will be a joyfull, comfortable, and moſt bleſſed day in many reſpects. It will be a day</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of their reſtauration, and perfect freedome from all infirmities, and imperfections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of full redemption from all miſeries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of finall deliverance from all ſins &amp; corruptions.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:156027:20"/> 4. Of glorious Coronation, when Palms of victory ſhall be put into their hands, and upon their heads ſhall be ſet a Crowne of incorruptible glory.</p>
               <p>Oh what a joy, and comfort will it be to ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Patriarchs, Prieſts, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſours, and all the reſt of the crowned, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Saints gathered into one companie, and ſtanding at the right hand of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>How will the faithfull be raviſhed to ſee Chriſt their Brother, their Advocate, their Head, their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, their Redeemer to ſit in the Seat of Judgement. But eſpecially, to heare him from thence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to them this bliſſefull ſentence. <hi>Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my Father, inherit a kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world, Matth.</hi> 25.43. thus joyfull, comfortable, and glorious will the day of Judgement be, to all ſuch as live in the feare of God, and the faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Which conſidered, I cannot but think it a ſtrange infirmitie of the Church in the dayes of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> when they uſually prayed <hi>pro mora finis:</hi> For the protraction and delay of the laſt end. Rather let all the godly pray with the Spouſe in the end of the <hi>Canticles; Make haſt my beloved,</hi> and as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did in the cloſe of his <hi>Revelation, Come Lord Ieſus.</hi> For when Chriſt comes, he comes to free us from all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to redeeme us from all miſeries, to deliver us from all ſins, and in full and perfect manner to endow us with Heaven, and with all Happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Doctrine of the laſt Judgement, ſerves for the Admonition of us all. To warn us while God doth afford us time &amp; means to take ſuch a courſe that we may gain the favor of the Judge, &amp; eſcape the ſeverity of the laſt judgment. And to this end with diligence, and good conſcience put in practice theſe ſix duties.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:156027:20"/> 1. Be thine own accuſer, in the free confeſſion of thy ſins to God; Conſidering what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, God is juſt, and faithfull to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be thine own Judge, and that in the ſtricteſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſevereſt condemnation of thy ſelf. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pray earneſtly unto God for pardon. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo long as the day of Grace laſteth, mercy may be found if we will but ſeeke it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beware of Judging the Perſons, and Actions of thy brethren. When a man doth well, do not judge ill; when he doth ill, do not make it worſe; when his ſpeeches or actions are doubtfull, take nothing in the worſt ſenſe, conſidering what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Iudge not and ye ſhall not be judged, Matth.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Labour to get a lively faith in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye wholly upon his merits for ſalvation. Conſidering what Chriſt ſaith. <hi>He that beleeveth hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, Iohn</hi> 5.24.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Endeavour to keepe a good conſcience in all things, voyd of offence before God, and all men: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith. <hi>Marke the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man and behold the juſt, for the last end of that man is peace, Pſal.</hi> 37.37.</p>
               <p>And now to wind up all in a word. If we be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of theſe important directions. If we confeſſe our ſins freely, condemne our ſelves ſeverely, pray for pardon earneſtly, judge our brethren charitably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Jeſus Chriſt ſtedfaſtly, and ſincerely deſire and endeavour to lead a godly, righteous and ſober life, then we ſhall finde Chriſt not a ſevere Judge to condemne us, but a mercifull Redeemer to abſolve,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:156027:21"/>and ſave us in that day on which God hath ordained him to Judge the world in righteouſneſſe. And now that our hearts may be ſo full of graces, and our lives ſo full of good works, that we may have in the end of our life, a comfortable death; and in the end of the World a glorious reſurrection to a bleſſed immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, let us all joyne together in faithfull and ſervent Prayer.</p>
               <p>O Moſt glorious, and moſt gracious Lord God, who haſt taught us to know, and beleeve that there ſhall be a day of judgement, on which we and all the world ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunall Seat of Chriſt, to render an account of all things done in the fleſh, whether good or evill; and to receive a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to our works. We moſt humbly beſeech thee to teach us to make a right and religious uſe of this faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Oh let theſe laſt things be ever in our Meditation, and ſo ſanctifie to us the remembrance thereof, that it may be a Bridle to reſtraine us from all ſin and wickedneſſe; and a Spur to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us powerfully, and effectually to unreined repentance for all our ſins, to conſtant patience in all our ſufferings, to a ſtedfaſt faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and to a true feare of thee in all our thoughts, words and actions throughout the whole courſe of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That ſo at whatſoever watch of the night, or houre of the day Chriſt ſhall come to Iudgement, he may finde us watching for him, walking with him, worthy to ſtand before him, and to enter with him into that kingdome, wherein thou dwelleſt, and the righteous onely ſhall dwell with thee in unutterable joy, and glory for evermore. This Grace here, this Glory hereafter, Lord grant unto us all, for his ſake who is the Son of thy Love, the Mediatour of thy choſen, Ieſus Chriſt. To whom with thee O Father, and the Spirit of Comfort, be aſcribed by us, and all the world, Kingdome, Power and Glory, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
